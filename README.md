# Gaussian Processes to Predict Gene Expression in Differentiating Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells 

This study aims to answer the question of whether GPs are appropriate for prediction in the context of gene expression in differentiating iPSCs or whether these newer methods overfit the data compared to the traditional baseline methods.
